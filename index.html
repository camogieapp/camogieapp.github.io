							<p class="agdasima-regular" style="text-align:justify;">Camógie is a fast paced stick and ball game. Similar to Hurling, Camógie is the female version of the Sport. Although there are similarities Camógie is not administered the GAA. Camógie has its own separate administration. Camóg is the name of the short stick used in the Sport. Later the word Camóg was Anglicised to Camógie giving the Sport its current name. Using a small ball called the Sliotar players have to pass within four steps of movement. Passing can be via the stick or foot and by open hand slapping. Camógie was founded in 1903 by Máire Ní Chinnéide and Cáit Ní Dhonnchadha. By 1932 the first 10 county All Ireland took place. Outside of the All Ireland Championships players hone their skills in the National Leagues. Camógie has become a global sport now played on every Continent.  Every year the top 15 players are awarded <a href="blog/carousel.html">All Star</a> status. <!-- By M V Flood https://www.redclick.ie/content-hub/everything-wanted-know-camogie -->
